# To display ads (from competitors) only to a website visitor which won't be a potential customer, detect/recognize and filer a non-customer
The simple filter displays (e.g. Google AdSense) ads from competitors only to a website visitor which is highly unprobable as a potential customer according to a geo location (physical distance to a business), browser language settings (culture and location), and device. In an efficient manner, businesses don't work via mobile phones and mobile devices are easily detectable. Simply, there's not often gonna happen a B2B deal when a visitor comes via a mobile phone because that visitor is neither in a physical workplace of an office (I know management occasionally working from coffee shops when they take a break on their travels, but almost none prefers a mobile phone because they strickly mind their work performance/speed so they always take their laptops), nor at home (for that same reasons related to their productivity like e.g. speed, compatibility of installable software, accessibility, etc... Also, contractors/self-employers don't usually come via mobile phones in their working time when they work from home).
