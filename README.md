# To display ads (from competitors) only to a website visitor which won't be a potential customer, detect/recognize and filer a non-customer
The simple filter displays (e.g. Google AdSense) ads from competitors only to a website visitor which is highly unprobable as a potential customer according to a geo location (physical distance to a business), browser language settings (culture and location), and device (businesses don't work via mobile phones and mobile devices are easily detectable. Simply, there's not often gonna happen a B2B deal when a visitor comes via a mobile device because that visitor is neither in a physical workplace of an office, nor doing it as a self-employer via a mobile phone in his/her working time).
